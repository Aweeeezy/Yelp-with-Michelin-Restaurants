Yelp-with-Michelin-Restaurants
===============================

Yelp-with-Michelin-Restaurants is an application that aims to get information about Michelin Restaurants which are not specifically indicated on Yelp's web page. Users can search for Michelin restaurants very easily and connect to the corresponding Yelp web page for more detailed information.

Components
---------------------------
Yelp-with-Michelin-Restaurants has a user-friendly interface including:

**Landing Page:**
* Search for restaurants with restaurants name, city, state, or category.
* View all restaurants, cities, states, or categories.

**Restaurant Information Page:**
* Displays the information for the restaurant you selected.
* Connects the user to the Yelp page via a URL link.

Getting Started
-----------------------
Yelp-with-Michelin-Restaurants is built entirely using Python's Django web framework. Simply install an up-to-date version of Django (we used version 1.10.6) and install the django-extensions.

To spool up the server, change into the web-app/michelinyelp directory and run the following command:
`python manage.py runserver`

This initializes the Django webserver at `localhost:8000`.
